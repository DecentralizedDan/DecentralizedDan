üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @DecentralizedDan. I'm a software engineer and product manager. My approach as a PM is informed by my six years of experience as a frontend and full stack engineer in the cybersecurity space. I'd like to think this makes me better at communicating with developers, prioritizing features and, yes, writing tickets. In other words...

üëÄ I love to read about: Engineering, design, leadership, and literature, as well as graphic novels of all kinds.

ü§ù How to work with me:

* Please OVERcommunicate!
  * Although I might not respond right away due to family commitments or just being asleep etc.
* I'm taking small steps into Radical Candor (tm)
  * I like to end meetings with "What's something I can keep doing to help you? What's something I can stop doing to help you?"
  * I pretty much won't end the meeting without getting a substantive response!
* Speaking of meetings! To keep them productive:
  * I make a detailed agenda for basically all of them
  * I start on time and with a quick check-in to see how folks are doing 
  * I record outcomes (decisions, tasks) and post them where appropriate for accountability
  * At the end of the meeting, I'll confirm those outcomes to make sure nothing is missing or wrong
  * I try to end early if at all possible
